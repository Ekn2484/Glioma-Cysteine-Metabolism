# Glioma-Cysteine-Metabolism

This repository contains the R code to reproduce the metabolomics results presented in Noch et al. "Cysteine induces mitochondrial reductive stress in glioblastoma through hydrogen peroxide production" (2021).

The script MetabolomicsAnalysis.R will automatically download the raw metabolomics data from Figshare and run the differential analysis as presented in the manuscript. The code will generate an html file (Glioma_GradeDifferentialAnalysis_CysteinePathway.html) and an Excel file (DifferentialAnalysisResults.xlsx), which will include detailed reporting of all preprocessing and statistical analysis steps.
